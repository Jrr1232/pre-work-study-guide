      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>A semantic element is an element of code that uses words to clearly represent what that element contains, in
          human language </li>
        <li>For the default display they are 2 types of elements; Block-level and Inline HTML elements</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS
          style sheet</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the
          property.</li>
        <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the
          head
          element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.
        </li>
        <li>Use . to designates a class selector</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li> A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.
        </li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git add -A: adds changed files in working directory to the staging area of Git</li>
        <li>git pull origin main: pulls the base branch into feature branch to make sure you are working on latest
          version</li>
        <li>git commit -m: commits changes in staging area to repo, -m flag is to associate a message with our commit

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. <br>
          Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, <br>
          and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:</li>
        <li>Some operators, ===: returns boolean, =: assigns a value, !==: the opposite value </li>
        <li>Variables are containers that store values</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. <br>
          Object properties are equivalent to key-value pairs</li>
        <li>JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it.
        </li>
        <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers</li>
        <li>localStorage allows us to store data and use it later.</li>
        <li>Arrow functions: () => instead of function()</li>
        <li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        </li>
        <li>Structured data:JSON</li>
        <li>As mentioned above, JavaScript is a weakly typed language. This means that you can often use a value of one
          type where another type is expected,<br>
          and the language will convert it to the right type for you.</li>
        <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites
        </li>
